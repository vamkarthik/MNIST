# MNIST Model Repository

This repository contains various **Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models** that can be used to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. The goal is to provide a collection of models ranging from basic ML classifiers to advanced deep learning architectures.

## About Data:
The MNIST dataset is a modified version of the **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset**, which originally contained handwritten digits from U.S. Census Bureau employees and high school students. MNIST was curated by **Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher Burges** in 1998 to provide a standardized dataset for benchmarking machine learning models. It consists of **60,000 training** and **10,000 test images** of handwritten digits (0-9), each represented as a **28x28 grayscale image**.
